Gaussian fit in order to find stellar center

In this matlab code, I used cftool in order to fit a gaussian curve to each star and find its center.
In the beginning, I load a solar eclipse image with several stars and zoom in a specific star. I give Matlab the pixels of the star in order to calculate the background and then fit a gaussian curve with cftool.
